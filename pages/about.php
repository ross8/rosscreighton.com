                    <p>It's a little tough to sum up my life thus far in a few short paragraphs, but I'll try to make a long story short. I was born and raised in Greenville, South Carolina...</p>

                    <p>I've been playing guitar and piano since my early teens and have been writing and performing songs for most of that time. Music is one of my biggest passions; it has given me confidence and has allowed my creative side to thrive. Recently, I've been fortunate to be able to perform my music for others and work on recording a couple songs.</p>

                    <p>Another passion in my life is basketball. I devoted endless hours to the sport in high school. I was never much of a star on the court, but the sport taught me invaluable life lessons, the most important of which being how to fail. I still play basketball on a weekly basis; it keeps my head clear and my competitive side alive.</p>

                    <div class="sub-heading">Service</div>
                    <p>I had always enjoyed math and physics, so after high school I enrolled at Clemson University to pursue a degree in engineering. I had a lot of fun at Clemson and made some amazing friends. I also discovered another passion: service. I worked on a volunteer basis with a group called Clemson Engineers for Developing Countries that works to improve quality of life in Haiti. I wore many hats within the organization, but spent most of my time as the Director of Technology Solutions. Giving my time to CEDC has kept me humble and grateful, and exposed me to places, people, and ideas that have made me a much more open-minded and well-rounded person.</p>

                    <p>Also during my time at Clemson, I took on my most fulfilling endeavor to date: web development. It started a few years ago when I needed a website for a business my friends and I were starting. It soon became a hobby, and later an obsession. Coding beautiful and functional websites is an exciting challenge for me; it satisfies me both analytically and creatively. I have spent most of my free time over the last few years learning everything I can about web development. My ultimate goal professionally is to become a full-stack developer and work on a project that changes the world.</p>

                    <p>Finally, I'd like to explain a motto of sorts that I have taken on over the years: "Love. Create. Maximize The Pursuit." These are the three things I strive to do every day. I show love to the people in my life. I try to create things, whatever the medium, that make the world a better place. And I try every day to maximize my personal pursuit of happiness.</p>
